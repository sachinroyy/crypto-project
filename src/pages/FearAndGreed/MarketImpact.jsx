        How Fear and Greed Affect the Market
      </h2>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-400">
        Extreme fear in the market often signals that many investors are selling
        due to uncertainty, which can lead to lower prices. This creates
        potential buying opportunities for those who take a long-term view.
        Conversely, when the market is driven by greed, investors may be overly
        optimistic, pushing prices higher than the assetâ€™s true value. This can
        lead to sudden corrections as the market readjusts. Understanding these
        emotional cycles can help you make more informed decisions, avoiding
        panic-selling during fearful times or buying into market hype during
        periods of greed.
